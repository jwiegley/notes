  ret : X -> Freer F X
  com : (Y : Set)(fy : F Y)(k : Y -> Freer F X) -> Freer F X

-- In Haskell, existentials are weak. You can't unpack Y from a com
-- and look at it. And you can't extract the fy from a com, as its
-- type would escape its scope.
-- In Type Theory, existentials are strong. There is no problem
-- about looking inside com.

-- The usual free presentation is

data DELAY (X : Set) : Set where
  now  : X -> DELAY X
  wait : DELAY X -> DELAY X

-- Predicativity makes the Yoneda encoding is a little tricky in Agda.
-- This direction is fine.

froYo : forall {X} -> Delay X -> DELAY X
froYo (ret x) = now x
froYo (com Y fy k) = wait (froYo (k fy))

-- For the other direction, Delay X is TOO BIG to be the witness to the
-- existential. I've given an equivalent encoding of the same data.
-- In Coq with impredicative Set, the size problem would go away, but
-- you'd still be picking a particular set as com's first argument.

toYo : forall {X} -> DELAY X -> Delay X
toYo (now x)  = (ret x)
toYo (wait d) = com One <> (\ _ -> toYo d)

-- In Haskell, there's no way to tell the following computation trees
-- apart. The Yoneda encoding maps them all to the tree which delays
-- once then returns <>.

check13 : froYo thing1 == froYo thing3
check13 = refl
check23 : froYo thing2 == froYo thing3
check23 = refl

-- In Type Theory, we can prove they're different.

diff12 : thing1 == thing2 -> Zero
diff12 q = diffOneTwo (subst q (\ b -> Type thing1 == Type b) refl)

diff13 : thing1 == thing3 -> Zero
diff13 q = diffOneTwo (subst q (\ b -> Type thing1 == Type b) refl)

diff23 : thing2 == thing3 -> Zero
diff23 q = diffTF
  (subst q (\ b ->
            (Q : Type b == Two) ->
            shape <> thing2 == subst Q (\ X -> X) (shape <> b))
  (\ { refl -> refl })
  refl)

-- So the Yoneda encoding is not an iso, unlike in Haskell.
