  This may be due to you not asking GHCi to load extra object files,
  archives or DLLs needed by your current session.  Restart GHCi, specifying
  the missing library using the -L/path/to/object/dir and -lmissinglibname
  flags, or simply by naming the relevant files on the GHCi command line.
  Alternatively, this link failure might indicate a bug in GHCi.
  If you suspect the latter, please send a bug report to:
