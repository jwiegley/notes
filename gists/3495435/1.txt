While the State monad is a thing you can push a value into, and later get that
same value back out, the Store Comonad is a thing you get a value out of *from
within a context*.  You can't edit the Store, as it's immutable, but you can
make a new Store based on the old Store, if the given Store allows that.

What makes a Store valuable is that it's essentially a data set with a cursor;
so like a really smart input iterator that can move backwards and forwards, or
absolutely.  Here's a simple example of a Store encapsulating a Map:

    type MapStore k v = Store k (Maybe v)

    foo' :: MapStore Int Int -> IO ()
    foo' st = do
      print $ extract st
      print $ peek 2 st
      let st' = seeks (+1) st       -- st' is now "based" at 4
      -- (have to use applicative because the return values are Maybes)
      print $ (+) <$> peeks pred st' <*> peeks succ st'

    bar' :: IO()
    bar' =
      -- create a store that looks up its values from a Map, with
      -- the "cursor" starting at 3.
      foo' $ store (\k -> M.lookup k $ fromList [ (1, 100)
                                                , (2, 200)
                                                , (3, 300)
                                                , (4, 400)
                                                , (5, 500) ])
                   3

The "cursor" for my Map starts at the key value 3.  If I 'extract' from this
Store, I'll get the value associated with 3.  I can use peek to access a value
related to a particular key, or peeks to pass a function that will compute a
relative offset.  seek and seeks do absolute and relative seeks, returning a
new store whose cursor is set at that position.

Where this gets interesting -- and I think, the whole reason for Comonads --
is that it abstracts the idea of traversing/inspecting a data space.  As long
as your data type (which could be a stream, an image, a Subversion repository)
supports the Comonad interface, you can write generic algorithms that are able
to sniff around and pass the returned data on to other functions.

    -- The Subversion store returns Left String to indicate failure (such as
    -- no more revisions), and Maybe a to represent each revision.  A revision
    -- can be Nothing if there is no data for that revision (this happens for
    -- revision in the Git-converted repository), or Just a.
    --
    -- What is 'a' here?  It's whatever data type you want to use to represent
    -- a revision.  By using a Store instead of a specific container type, we
    -- defer the choice of container.  It could end up being a Map, an
    -- association list, a BTree, a database... or even shell out to
    -- Subversion to obtain the requested information on demand.

    type SvnRepository a = Store Int (Either String (Maybe a))

    -- Function to process the contents of a Subversion store and return the
    -- results as a list.
    processSvn :: (a -> b) -> SvnStore a -> [b]
    processSvn f st = 
      case extract st of
        Left _         -> []                            -- at the end/error
        Right Nothing  -> processSvn f $ seeks (+1) st  -- skip it
        Right (Just x) -> f x : processSvn f $ seeks (+1) st

With a Comonad, there is no easy way to do this.  Let's say our SvnRepository
store actually shells out to "svn log -r X" to extract the information
relating to revision X.  But rather than doing a linear walk, as we do above,
you want to write code that examines everything 1000th revision.

Without a Comonad, the best we can do is create a list of IO actions (thus
infecting our traversal code with the IO monad), and either (a) only produce
actions for every 1000th revision, which means the caller needs special
knowledge, or (b) produce promises for every revision, but keep calling "drop
999" so they don't get evaluated.  With the Comonad, we both avoid infection
(the "IO context" is in the input value, not the result), and we only cause
actions to occur for the specific revisions we're interested in.
