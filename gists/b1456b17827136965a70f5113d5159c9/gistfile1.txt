cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: hnix-0.5.2 (user goal)
[__1] rejecting: hnix:!test (constraint from config file, command line flag,
or user target requires opposite flag selection)
[__1] trying: hnix:*test
[__2] next goal: hnix:hspec-discover:exe.hspec-discover (dependency of hnix
*test)
[__2] rejecting: hnix:hspec-discover:exe.hspec-discover-2.6.1/installed-1hN...
(does not contain executable 'hspec-discover', which is required by hnix
*test)
[__2] fail (backjumping, conflict set: hnix,
hnix:hspec-discover:exe.hspec-discover, hnix:test)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the
goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: hnix, hnix:test,
hnix:hspec-discover:exe.hspec-discover
