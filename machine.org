> Don't buy the monitor from us as Amazon has a great price on it. We don't
  price match and Amazon can't even provide graphics cards at the moment.

> You can send us two parts for free and each additional two parts will add
  $50 to the cost of the system. We won't accept: power supplies,
  motherboards, or chassis. The other costs are the chassis, warranty and
  overnight service which we provide for warranty repairs for the first year.
